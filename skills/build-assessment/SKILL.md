# /comply:build-assessment — Rego Policy Generation

Generate Rego policies from Gemara Control Catalogs. This is the single entry point for policy generation — it drives test generation, human approval, and policy creation.

**Core principle:** Test cases first, human approval, then policy. Read all data from MCP, never from model memory.

## Mode Selection

Parse the mode from the skill argument:

- `/comply:build-assessment` — single mode (default)
- `/comply:build-assessment single` — explicit single mode
- `/comply:build-assessment batch` — batch mode

## Prerequisite

MCP must be configured (`comply:mcp-setup`). If `.mcp.json` does not exist or the complypack MCP server is unreachable, stop and invoke `comply:mcp-setup` first.

## Step 1: Scope — Get the Requirement List

1. Call `get_automation_triage` with the policy name
2. Collect the `automated` list — these are the requirements to generate policies for
3. Note the `manual` list — inform the user these need human review, not policy generation
4. If no automated requirements, inform the user and stop

## Single Mode

Process one requirement at a time. Show **"Requirement N of M"** at every pause point.

### Before the Loop: Ask About Helpers

Ask once before starting the per-requirement loop. Use `AskUserQuestion`:

- header: "Helpers"
- question: "Do you have any reusable code (Rego functions, data files, patterns) to use across these policies?"
- options: "No, generate fresh" / "Yes, I'll provide them"

If the user selects "Yes", wait for them to provide the helpers. Note them for use in all test and policy drafts. The user can also offer new helpers during any requirement's review — incorporate them going forward.

### Pause 1: Present the Requirement

Show:
- Counter: **"Requirement N of M"**
- Requirement ID
- Description (from the control definition read via MCP — `complypack://catalog/*`)

Then use `AskUserQuestion`:

- header: "Requirement"
- question: "Requirement N of M: `<ID>` — <title>. Proceed with this requirement?"
- options: "Continue" (generate checks for this requirement) / "Skip" (move to the next requirement)

Do not suggest checks, show code, or take any action until the user responds.

### Pause 2: Suggest Checks and Show Variable Usage

1. Call `get_assessment_requirements` to extract parameter values and thresholds
2. Read the platform schema via MCP (`complypack://schema/*`) for valid `input.*` paths

Show:
- Suggested deny check — what condition should trigger a violation, stated in plain language
- Suggested allow check — what condition should pass cleanly, stated in plain language
- Parameter values from `get_assessment_requirements` and how they will be used as expected values in test assertions
- The `input.*` paths from the platform schema that will be referenced

Then use `AskUserQuestion`:

- header: "Checks"
- question: "Do these checks and variables look correct?"
- options: "Looks good" (proceed to test draft) / "Adjust" (I'll describe what to change)

If the user selects "Adjust", wait for their changes, apply them, and re-present.

### Pause 3: Show Draft Test for Approval

Generate a complete `_test.rego` file with:
- `package policy` and `import rego.v1`
- One `test_deny_*` function — input that should trigger a violation, using `with input as {...}` with inline test data
- One `test_allow_*` function — input that should pass cleanly, using `with input as {...}` with inline test data
- One-line comment per test function stating what it checks in plain language
- Test data JSON paths from the platform schema
- Parameter values from `get_assessment_requirements`, not sample data
- Incorporate any helpers provided before the loop

Show the complete test file to the user. Then use `AskUserQuestion`:

- header: "Test"
- question: "Approve this test case for `<requirement_id>`?"
- options: "Approve" (write to disk and proceed) / "Revise" (I'll describe what to change)

**This is the hard gate.** If the user selects "Revise", wait for their changes, revise, and re-present with `AskUserQuestion` again. Do not proceed until the user selects "Approve".

On approval, write the test file to `policy/<requirement>_test.rego`.

### Pause 4: Generate Policy and Recommend Review

1. Generate the Rego policy file:
   - Read control definition from MCP (`complypack://catalog/*`)
   - Use parameter values from `get_assessment_requirements` for thresholds and accepted values
   - Write `input.*` paths from the platform schema — do not reverse-engineer from sample manifests
   - Incorporate any helpers provided before the loop
   - One file per requirement, named `policy/<requirement>.rego`
   - Use `deny contains msg if { ... }` format with `import rego.v1`
   - Identify the subject in denial messages using schema fields (e.g., `input.metadata.name`)
   - No hardcoded values from test data
2. Run `validate_policy` — confirm zero contract violations
3. If contract violations: fix `input.*` paths to match the schema and re-validate
4. Run `test_policy` with combined policy + test content as `policyContent`
5. If tests fail: revise the **policy**, not the tests — the tests were human-approved
6. Repeat validation until all tests pass
7. Write the passing policy to `policy/<requirement>.rego`

Show the complete `.rego` policy file and test pass confirmation. Then use `AskUserQuestion`:

- header: "Policy"
- question: "Policy for `<requirement_id>` passed all tests. N of M remaining. Approve?"
- options: "Approve" (move to next requirement) / "Want changes" (I'll describe what to change)

This is a soft gate. If the user selects "Want changes", revise the policy, re-run tests, and re-present with `AskUserQuestion` again.

Loop back to **Pause 1** for the next requirement.

## Batch Mode

Process all requirements at once in two phases.

### Phase 1: All Tests

1. Call `get_automation_triage` to get the automated requirement list (already done in Step 1)
2. Ask about helpers once using `AskUserQuestion` (same as single mode's pre-loop question)
3. For each automated requirement:
   - Read the control definition from MCP
   - Call `get_assessment_requirements` for parameters
   - Read the platform schema
   - Generate one `test_deny_*` and one `test_allow_*` function with inline `with input as` data
4. Present all test cases together with requirement IDs and descriptions
5. Counter: **"Generated tests for N of M requirements"**
6. Use `AskUserQuestion`:
   - header: "Tests"
   - question: "Generated tests for N of M requirements. Approve all?"
   - options: "Approve all" (write to disk) / "Flag specific tests" (I'll list which ones to revise)
7. If user flags tests, revise and re-present until approved
8. Write all approved tests to `policy/*_test.rego`

### Phase 2: All Policies

1. For each approved requirement:
   - Generate Rego policy from MCP data, using helpers if provided
   - Run `validate_policy` (contract check)
   - Run `test_policy` (test suite)
   - If tests fail: revise the policy, re-run — never modify approved tests
2. Present all passing policies for review
3. Counter: **"Policies passing: N of M"**
4. Use `AskUserQuestion`:
   - header: "Policies"
   - question: "N of M policies passing. Approve all?"
   - options: "Approve all" (write to disk) / "Want changes" (I'll list which ones to revise)
5. If the user wants changes to specific policies, revise, re-test, re-present
6. Write all passing policies to `policy/*.rego`

## MCP Resources and Tools

- `complypack://catalog/*` — Control Catalogs, Guidance Catalogs, Policies
- `complypack://schema/*` — Platform schemas
- `complypack://evaluator` — Available evaluators
- `get_automation_triage` — Classify assessment plans as Automated or Manual
- `get_assessment_requirements` — Extract assessment requirements with parameters
- `validate_policy` — Validate policy syntax and contract compliance
- `test_policy` — Run policy tests

## Red Flags — STOP AND FIX IF THERE ARE ISSUES

- [ ] MCP is unreachable → **STOP.** Do not generate from general knowledge. Inform the user and wait.
- [ ] No approved test files before policy generation → **STOP.** Tests come first.
- [ ] `input.*` paths not in the platform schema → **STOP.** Fix to match schema.
- [ ] Hardcoded values from sample inputs instead of parameters → **STOP.** Use `get_assessment_requirements`.
- [ ] Approved test cases modified to make policy pass → **STOP.** Revert tests, fix policy.
- [ ] Missing deny or allow test for a requirement → **STOP.** Add the missing test.
- [ ] Control IDs or parameter values from model memory → **STOP.** Re-read from MCP.
- [ ] User has not approved test scenarios (single mode) → **STOP.** Wait for approval.
- [ ] `validate_policy` not run before `test_policy` → **STOP.** Contract check first.
